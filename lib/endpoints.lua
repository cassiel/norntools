    Support for MIDI ports from script's parameter setup
    (rather than using indices and the global port list).
    The script is expected to provide device "role" keys x names
    (such as "grid" x "Grid input", "daw" x "To DAW" -
    or device identifiers like "wavestate", "modwave" which
    make sense to the script).

    Argument: table of:
        key -> name * (msg callback)

    Result returned: table of:
        key -> (MIDI endpoint index, for transmission)
        NB: this returned table is mutable, if params change!

    Side-effect: parameters registered in PARAMETERS page.
